# Demos: Block 3 - DS&A, Designs, Comp Sci, Recap 

### Trees

[Common Curriculum Trees Demo](https://github.com/codefellows/common_curriculum/tree/master/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/demos/javascript)

* Create the core tree structure
* Code out Pre-Order Traversal
  * Explain what it means to evaluate the node when you're 'on it'
* Pseudo Code Breadth First Traversal
* Whiteboard the add method for a BST
  * Note that it uses a while loop, not necessarily recursion.

### Forms (SASS)

* Demo form designs and targeting
  * `<label>` surrounding the fields and as siblings
  * Pros and Cons thereof
  * Form field attributes
    * Active, Focus, Disabled, etc

It has been helpful in the past to talk about, with drawings, how these can work and then pair program part of the implementation with either a TA or a student, getting input from the class

Generally speaking, the SASS demos are great when interactively, as most students have a decent understanding of CSS and are much more willing to contribute ideas.


### Project / Lab Prep

* This should again be a discussion and not a pure code demo. 
* The students should leave with good understanding of how to approach the task.
* Demo both apps to the students - the API and Auth servers
  * Talk through the requirements of integration
  * How might we authenticate the routes?
  * What needs to be documented and tested?
  * What are our test approaches?
  * Why would we make authentication optional?
  * How might we do that?
