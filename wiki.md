### Engineering Topics (Blog entry)

One of the most important skills that employers look for in a programmer is their ability to solve problems. Problem solving
skills are usually viewed as more important than syntactic knowledge or technical skill, so every programmer should make sure they 
are approaching each problem in the best way possible. When you're given a problem, sometimes it's best to break it down into smaller 
sub-problems, which are easier to solve. Depending on the scope of the problem, this can be a very effective tactic. A lot of programmers 
are itching to jump into coding right away, or as soon as they get it mostly figured out, but it can also be beneficial to wait 
and make sure that you completely understand how everything will piece together before you even touch a keyboard.

### Authentication 

When users log in to sites or need to provide credentials, the most important thing as a developer is ensuring that those credentials stay hidden. This is often done by encrypting the user's password before storing it in a database, which, depending on the type of encryption and the algorithm, can be very effective. Authentication occurs whenever a user visits a different page where they would need to retain their credentials, rather than entering them whenever they navigate elsewhere on the site. This is where tokens come in. Tokens allow users to store a key locally that is sent to the server with each subsequent request, and allows the server to compare it with the encrypted password in their database to authorize access to user info on other pages.
