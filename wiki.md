One of the most important skills that employers look for in a programmer is their ability to solve problems. Problem solving
skills are usually viewed as more important than syntactic knowledge or technical skill, so every programmer should make sure they 
are approaching each problem in the best way possible. When you're given a problem, sometimes it's best to break it down into smaller 
sub-problems, which are easier to solve. Depending on the scope of the problem, this can be a very effective tactic. A lot of programmers 
are itching to jump into coding right away, or as soon as they get it mostly figured out, but it can also be beneficial to wait 
and make sure that you completely understand how everything will piece together before you even touch a keyboard.
